A Github action to automatically approves PRs based on user names or other criteria. It should be used to automatically approve PRs that are generated by automations, like renovate, automatic version bumps, or others.

Use it like this:
```yaml
name: Autoapprove

on:
  pull_request: # TODO approve PRs that match right away, remove if approvals should be issued on a schedule only (see below)
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0' # TODO approve all PRs based on a schedule, remove if no schedule intended

jobs:
  approve:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - uses: plengauer/autoapprove@main # TODO pin to a version if needed
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # TODO token for GITHUB for the user to approve the PRs with (if a custom token is used that is not the built-in token, set permissions above)
          user_to_approve: 'renovate[bot]' # TODO configure user
```
